            <h1>All About</h1>
            <p>Ever since she was a child, Riley has been in love with all things art.  She started with drawing and painting, getting tips and tricks from her grandma who has her paintings shared around the world, and her aunt who sells commission paintings.  She dabbled in abstract paintings and later moved more into nature paintings, specifically flowers.</p>

                <p>She’s also experimented in print and sticker making, creating prints and stickers on procreate and selling them through her instagram and at art markets.  She loves to combine different mediums, creating paintings using acrylic paint as well as expired tattoo ink and paint pens and she loves to learn new ways of expressing her artistic side whether it be through jewelry making, drawing and painting, graphic design or illustrations.

            <h3>Tattooing</h3>
            <p>Riley got a taste of the graphic design world when she first started tattooing.  By creating posts for her website and instagram to build her clientele she learnt a bit about composition and color theory.  She was also given the opportunity to create a logo for a client’s new essential oil business which really peaked her interest in graphic design. </p> 

            <p>After a couple years in the tattoo industry she decided to go for a change in career, feeling pulled towards the graphic design world.  She wanted to learn more about visual language, typography, how to clearly and creatively portray ideas and concepts and how to use the adobe programs.  She is currently in the Graphic Design program at BCIT hoping to expand her knowledge and learn all about what it takes to become a graphic designer.
